Deploy a new Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure (Service Manager)
============================================================

            

This script uses the Azure Service Management API to deploy a Virtual Machine.


This script presumes that you have the Azure module installed.


This script presumes that you are connected to your subscription and have set your storage account.


This script presumes that you have already setup your virtual network.


This is a sample script that you can use or leverage for demo's etc.


I recommend not to use this script if you are just starting out, instead focus on the Azure Resource Manager API instead (of service management api).

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
